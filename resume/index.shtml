		<p><b>Short Bio (Updated July 27th, 2011)</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Guangzhou, P.R. China. Guangzhou is located in the very south of China and is known as the "Southern Door of China". I attended Kindergarten, elemental school, middle school, high school, and college in Guangzhou. I graduated from junior high in 2000 and high school in 2003, all from the Guangzhou No.2 Middle School.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended South China Normal University in 2003, and was initially in an honor program in social sciences (mainly in Economics, Management and Psychology). I then tranferred to Department of Economics after 3 semesters of comprehensive studies in social sciences.My first interests in Economics were Macroeconomics and Development Economics. But after I met my undergraduate supervisor, Dr. Zhiqiang Dong, a game theorist, in my senior year, plus professors in other universities, my interests rapidly changed to Microeconomics and Game theory, as well as Behavioral Economics and Experimental Economics.</P>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My undergraduate thesis was titled "The Evolution of Cooperation Theory", under Dr. Dong's supervision. It was written in English instead of Chinese because I planned to study abroad and wanted to show my proficiency in English. It got the highest score among all theses in the year I graduated.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from the South China Normal University in year 2007. Due to the fact that I took TOEFL and GRE exams late, I did not apply for universities in US in year 2006 so I missed the chance to enroll in fall, 2007. In 2008, I applied for 10 universities including Kansas State University, and decided to attend K-State.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year when I was preparing for study abroad, I read books and papers, besides translating some papers and books for different professors as part of some publication programs. I flied to the States on August 9th, the day after the 2008 Beijing Olympic Ceremony.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First enrolled as a Master's student, I had different plans in my head when I got here at K-State. But all of the plans at that time link to a fact that I have to find a major advisor and have a paper published. Somehow, now, I'm more than succeed in this goal.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to stay in Kansas State University for my Ph.D. study after having completed a paper with Dr. Yang-Ming Chang. Now I have completed couple more and keep working. I taught couple sessions of Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON520). I also taught Principles of Microeconomics (ECON120) and Principles of Macroeconomics (ECON110).  I always feel that I am excited about teaching.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got married with Daru Zhang on May 6th, 2011.  I will be on the job market this year and will attend the 2012 AEA/ASSA meetings in Chicago, IL.</p>
